INSTALL for IFOS2D
==================

A detailed installation instruction is provided in the chapter 5 of the 
documentation (IFOS/doc/manual_IFOS.pdf). If the manual is not compiled,
please use the script IFOS/doc/compile_LaTeX_manual.sh

To compile IFOS2D a MAKEFILE is available in the IFOS/par directory. To
use the MAKEFILE type

make <COMPILER_OPTIONS>

in the IFOS2D/par directory. COMPILER_OPTIONS are optional arguments.  Valid 
values for COMPILER_OPTIONS are described below.  The MAKEFILE compiles 
the additional libaries

lib cseife
lib stfinv
lib aff
lib fourier

before compiling the main program IFOS2D.

-------------------------------------------

There are several known dependencies:

- working C/C++ compiler (Intel ICC and GNU gcc/g++ tested)
- working MPI implementation
- FFTW library (version 3)
- standard c++ and math libraries (libstdc.a, libm.a)

-------------------------------------------


VALID COMPILER OPTIONS
======================

As stated previously, the MAKEFILE in the IFOS2D/par subdirectory will accept a 
number of optional arguments:

  PARALLEL_IO    -> set to 1 if the user wishes to enable parallel IO. If you are 
                    running IFOS2D on a cluster with a parallel filesystem 
                    (like Lustre or GPFS), this can increase performance significantly.

  INTEL_COMPILER -> set to 1 if you wish to build IFOS2D with the Intel suite of 
                    compilers (icc/icpc/ifort).  Note that this is default.

  CRAY_COMPILER  -> set to 1 if you wish to build IFOS2D with the CRAY suite of 
                    compilers (craycc).

  G717           -> set to 1 if you wish to build the large production test case.

Example: to build IFOS2D with the Cray compilers and with parallel I/O enabled,
         one would use the following make command:

          make PARALLEL_IO=1 CRAY_COMPILER=1
