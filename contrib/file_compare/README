Three simple utilities have been created to assist with a quick parsing and verification of output 
data files.

file_compare -> prints the contents of 2 user-defined output files and displays the # of mismatching 
                values

global_file_read -> display the contents of an output file containing the global domain

local_file_read -> display the contents of an output file containing the local domain
