FOURIER --- Fourier coefficients library
-------------------------------
$Id$
============================================================================

For compilation instructions see README.1st in the root directory of the tar-ball or
http://gpitrsvn.gpi.uni-karlsruhe.de:8000/TFSoftware/wiki/docs/installation 

The library provides modules to perform Fourier transformations and to 
operate on Fourier transforms.An interface to FFTW is available.Signal 
filters can be defined by their Fourier domain response function and applied 
to the Fourier transform of a signal. libaff is used to store Fourier 
coefficients and time series samples.Further stuff will be collected in 
this library in the future.

Binary libraries
----------------
 libfourier.a         Fortran library
 libfourierxx.a               C++ library

Dependencies
------------
 libaff is required to compile the binary libraries
 fftw3 is required for the C++ library
 doxygen is required to process source code documentation

Installation
------------
 environment variables:
  LOCINCLUDEDIR   Defines the path where header files will be copied for
                  usage in your own projects. You will pass this path to
                  the precompiler with the -I option.
  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
                  placed.
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   Defines the path to your personal homepage. That's the
                  place where doxygen output will be written too (see
                  in the Makefile).

make all             installs headers, binary libraries and documentation


Detailed documentation is provided through libfourier.doc (fortran code) 
and doxygen source code. See target doxydoc in the Makefile.
